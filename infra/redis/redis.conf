# Limit memory – required for eviction to ever happen

# Use LFU eviction on all keys
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lfu

# Optional: tweak LFU counters (defaults are usually fine)
# volatile-lfu and allkeys-lfu use these:
# lfucache is based on log-approximate counters

# Number of minutes to decay the counters
lfu-decay-time 1

# Initial counter value for new keys
lfu-log-factor 10
